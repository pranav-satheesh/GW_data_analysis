    "To understand what's going on here, let's establish a few definitions. When we set `a = 1.234`, we created a *mapping* from the object called `a` to the value `1.234`. We created similar mappings for `b` and `c`. Likewise, when we defined the function `floor`, we created a mapping from the object called `floor` to the block of code defined above. A collection of mappings is called a *namespace*. Currently, the namespace of our notebook/module (called the module's `global` namespace) is `a`, `b`, `c`, and `floor`. Our notebook also has access to Python's `builtins` namespace. The *[scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science))* of the notebook --- i.e., the collection of namespaces that are searched to resolve objects --- is the notebook's namespace plus the `builtins`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a function, we essentially define a new, *local* namespace within that function. The function's local namespace includes all of the arguments that the function takes, plus any mappings that are created within that function. So, when we called `floor(a)`, a namespace was created in which a local object `x` was mapped to the value of `a`, `1.234`. The code within `floor` was then evaluated. Since `1.234` is greater than 0, this line was executed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x = int(x)\n",

    "At this point the local `x` is remapped to the integer `1`. The line `return x` then passes the value that `x` is mapped to back to the notebook. At this point, *the function's namespace is deleted*, meaning that the object `x` ceases to exist. The same applies to any mappings that are defined within the function. For example:"

    "In PyCBC Inference we have support for several different samplers, such as `emcee`, `emcee_pt`, etc. Each of these samplers has different properties that need to be set in order for it to function correctly. For example, `emcee` needs to know how many walkers to use, whereas `emcee_pt` needs to have the number of walkers *and* the number of temperatures set. For this reason, we define a different class for each sampler; e.g., for `emcee` we use the [EmceeEnsembleSampler](https://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/pycbc.inference.sampler.html#pycbc.inference.sampler.emcee.EmceeEnsembleSampler) class while for `emcee_pt` we use the [EmceePTSampler](https://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/pycbc.inference.sampler.html#pycbc.inference.sampler.emcee_pt.EmceePTSampler) class.\n",

Then we can write a program like `pycbc_inference` that, regardless of the sampler that the user selects, can simply do `sampler.run()`.\n",
